# Google Knowledge Graph

## Introduction
-   Introduced in 2012 with three intentions
    

-   Find the right thing

	-   Ambiguity
-   Get the best summary

	-   summarize relevant content
-   Go deeper and broader
    
	-   unexpected discoveries



Google Knowledge Graph API uses the schema from schema.org

## How does the Google Graph Work?
Google is unfortunately not entirely transparent with their implementation, however some information is available

-   Data is organized with entity names, types, attributes, relevance scores and entity types
    
-   Google tries to recognize entities and then draw relevant information from existing knowledge bases


The Knowledge Graph can be described with 3 Layers:

1.  Entity Catalogue: identified entities are saved
    
2.  Knowledge Repository: Entities are connected with attributes from knowledge bases
    
3. Knowledge Graph: Entities are connected with each other via relations

## LD+JSON
-   JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data
    
-   W3C Recommendation

## Knowledge Graph Search API

-   With the knowledge Graph Search API, users can directly fetch the information on specific entities
    
-   It uses the standards from schema.org
    
-   Users can review a ranked list for entities that match specific criteria
    
-   The API only returns entities and does not allow users to review the graph itself

## Google Graph Application

-   Google knowledge panel
    

-   Title and short summary of the topic
    
-   A longer description of the subject
    
-   A picture or pictures of the person, place or thing
    
-   Key facts, such as when a notable figure was born or where something is located
    
-   Links to social profiles and official websites
-   500 billion facts about five billion entities

-   Enrollment on mobile

## Google Knowledge Vault
- Confirmed by Google in 2014
- Not much information except the original paper
- Web-scale probabilistic knowledge base
- supervised machine learning methods for fusing distinct information sources
- Supposed to be bigger than the Knowledge Graph


## Pros of Featured Snippets and Knowledge Panels

-   As a customer/consumer
    
    - Direct satisfaction of information need
    
    -  	Less than Half of Google Searches Now Result in a Click
